# predicting_higher_education_outcomes_ML
This project uses different classification models to examine Portuguese high school student performance. The main goal of this project was to find the features that most influence whether a student plans to acheive higher education and compare a breadth of classification models to find the optimal algorithm. This project was completed as a final project for my Machine Learning class in college.
